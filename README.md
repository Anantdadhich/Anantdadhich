Frameworks & Libraries: React.js (building dynamic UIs with ease), Node.js (king of the back-end), Express.js (building APIs like a pro), Next.js (SEO-friendly apps in a flash!), Hono.js (serverless functions for the win)
Tools & Technologies: Git (version control master), GitHub (showcasing my code to the world!), ShadeCn (let's talk design!), Steam.io (deployment made simple), Docker (containerizing my apps), Cloudflare (speeding things up!), AWS Cloud Services (ready to dive deeper)
Soft Skills: Communication that's clear and concise, teamwork that's a dream come true, problem-solving skills that amaze, and time management that's on fire
